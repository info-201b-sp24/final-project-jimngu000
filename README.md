# Introduction

The goal of this project is to explore how technology usage influences mental health across a wide variety of demographics, as well as look into the state of mental health and mental health treatments in the tech industry. Some of the questions I hope to answer while exploring this domain include:

- How common is it for companies to provide mental health assistance/treatments?
- Are certain groups of people more prone to unhealthy social media usage, and how much does this vary?
- What are some possible factors that might affect whether or not employees in the tech industry are willing to seek out mental health treatments?
  
These questions are motivated by a desire to understand the role of technology in addressing our everyday mental health, especially with its increasing prevalence in society over time. Answering these questions is important because it would give more insight as to how technology might have different impacts on mental health across different demographics, as well as ultimately guiding healthcare providers, researchers, and other individuals to promoting positive mental health and well-being.

# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways

As a result of my research, I noticed some trends that helped me lean towards certain answers for my initial response questions. For example, I noticed that it is becoming relatively more common that larger-size companies are providing mental health benefits, according to responses given in the tech survey I analyzed. Washington, one of the states with the highest number of respondents, had over 75 employees from companies with more than 1000 people responding that their company provided mental health care benefits. California also had over 300 employees from companies with over 1000 people indicating that their company provided mental health benefits, and over 50 employees from companies with 100-500 people indicating the same.

Another trend I noticed was that university and school students are more likely to utilize social media for an unhealthy amount of time. According to the chart on social media usage by occupation, over 75 respondents who selected “University Student” as their occupation claim they use social media for more than 5 hours per day. Whereas only roughly 40 respondents reported using social media for between 1-2 hours or less than an hour per day. Experts generally recommend only between 30 minutes to 2 hours of social media per day for it to be considered a healthy level of usage, so it was interesting to see how the level of healthy social media usage differed across occupations and even within the same ones.

Finally, after analyzing my chart on age distribution of mental health conditions by state, I found that there tended to be more data for employees suffering from mental health conditions who sought out mental health treatment compared to those who did not seek out treatment. Of those who sought out treatment and were in mid-level companies (26-100 people), the average range of ages was 25-40 years old, with the exception of employees from the state of Massachusetts (roughly 25-45). I thought this was interesting because it showed how those who are generally earlier on in their career might be more likely to treat their mental health conditions. I also thought it was interesting that the ranges varied so much across different states, which might indicate different socioeconomic dynamics that influence the likelihood of someone seeking out mental health care.

Overall, the most important insight I achieved from my analysis was discovering how there are so many factors besides technological usage that come into play when determining the likelihood of someone treating their mental health conditions, assuming they are suffering from any. This calls back to my original motivation for the project, as I believe experimenting more with these aforementioned factors and determining how heavily they can impact mental health care will ultimately allow healthcare providers and other individuals to promote and pursue positive mental health and well-being.
